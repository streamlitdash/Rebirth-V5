# Rebirth: Full Cold-Start, Concurrency, Portfolio-Reduction, and UI Performance Guide

> Historical audit only. Do not implement verbatim;
> `docs/rebirth-v3/v3.2/REVISION_V3_2.md` supersedes conflicts.

**Repository audited:** `streamlitdash/Rebirth`  
**Code baseline:** commit `e715d7c5eefd562e8eea8066ea1a3128e382e5ed`  
**Current `main` at the time of this audit:** `bd8ae49b5c743471afcc831f7e6bb50f56e35eb3`  
The only code difference between those two commits is the added file `rebirth_cohesive_implementation_guide.md`; the Python application code is unchanged.

This guide combines the previous implementation guide with a deeper cold-start and connector-concurrency audit. It is written as an implementation sequence. Follow the steps in order.


## Implementation order

Apply the guide in this sequence:

1. Add the cold-start watcher and source-level timeouts.
2. Make startup server-owned and repair the hero/revision handoff.
3. Stop copying full snapshots and constructing initial tables twice.
4. Add bounded connector task workers, keeping fake mode at one worker initially.
5. Parallelize the three real Portfolio sources and configure native API timeouts.
6. Collapse Portfolio and remove every analytical UI dependency on it.
7. Apply the Credit, tenor and duplicate-market changes.
8. Replace the Stock hierarchy with Aggregate Stock.
9. Tune Gunicorn threads and serialization only after the functional changes pass.
10. Run the focused tests, complete suite, cold-start watcher and production acceptance checklist.

---

# 1. The key diagnosis

Portfolio is **not proven to be the direct cause of Cube never opening**.

Portfolio currently causes a very large **final analytical frame**, a large Quick Search catalogue, large Dash callback payloads, and expensive hierarchy construction. It can therefore make the last part of startup and page navigation appear frozen.

However, the initial refresh obtains market data by looping over **unique Underlyings**, not Portfolios. If startup is stuck while the active function is a market connector, deleting the Portfolio filter will not fix that connector call.

The current cold-start path has several independent risks:

1. `StartupCoordinator.schedule_start()` exists, but the production page builders do not call it. Startup therefore depends on browser JavaScript or a Dash interval reaching `/startz` or the startup callback.
2. Open and Current market calls are made sequentially for every Underlying within every product.
3. The recovered real async bridge uses a single-worker executor. If enabled as written, it serializes all async calls and can deadlock if it is ever called recursively from its own worker.
4. Real synchronous connectors have no guaranteed hard I/O timeout in the shared framework. The 2,400-second startup watchdog reports a stall but cannot terminate a blocked Python call.
5. The final refresh stage loads portfolio configuration, attaches reporting mappings, builds the analytical frame, builds the search catalogue, commits the snapshot, and then defensively copies every large DataFrame even though the startup coordinator discards the returned copy.
6. The startup page and shared-shell callbacks can both copy/materialize large snapshot data at the same time.
7. `build_layout()` constructs the initial Risk hierarchy and Aggregate P&L table, then mounted callbacks build them again.
8. The shared hero starts hidden, and successful completion is hidden after only 300 milliseconds.
9. `dashboard_frame` still contains raw Portfolio, and Quick Search still indexes it.

The correct solution is therefore **both**:

- make cold-start ownership, timeouts, progress, and task concurrency reliable; and
- reduce the amount of data that reaches the final dashboard and browser.

# 2. Understand the four different meanings of “worker”

Do not mix these concepts:

| Worker type | What it does | Recommended setting |
|---|---|---|
| Gunicorn worker | A separate Python process serving HTTP requests | Keep `1` for now |
| Gunicorn thread | A request-handling thread inside the one process | Keep `4`, then benchmark `8` |
| Connector task worker | A `ThreadPoolExecutor` task that overlaps blocking source I/O | Fake `1/1`; real start Risk `2`, Market `4` |
| Async event-loop worker | One background event-loop thread that can run many awaiting coroutines | One loop thread, many coroutines |

Do **not** set Gunicorn `workers=2` yet. Each Gunicorn worker would own a separate refresh manager, snapshot, revision, search catalogue, caches, locks, Stock state, and startup coordinator. Requests could then land on different financial revisions.

The multi-worker improvement in this guide is **connector task concurrency inside the one authoritative process**.

---

# 3. Create a safe branch and remove the accidentally committed guide

The repository test `tests/s13_publish.py::test_root_readme_is_the_only_markdown_document` requires `README.md` to be the only Markdown file in the repository. The current `main` contains `rebirth_cohesive_implementation_guide.md`, so that test will fail.

Run:

```bash
git checkout -b fix/cube-cold-start-and-performance
git rm rebirth_cohesive_implementation_guide.md
git status
```

Keep this downloaded guide outside the repository.

Create a baseline test log:

```bash
python -m pytest -q > baseline-pytest.txt
python -m ruff check . > baseline-ruff.txt
```

Commit the clean baseline before changing application code:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Remove temporary implementation guide from runtime repository"
```

---

# 4. Add a standalone cold-start watcher

This distinguishes “no refresh started”, “connector is stuck”, “final DataFrame work is slow”, and “revision committed but browser handoff is stuck”.

Run locally with:

```bash
python tools/s04_watch_startup.py \
  --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8050 \
  --prefix /
```

For a proxied deployment, use the public Dash request prefix, not the internal Flask route prefix.

Interpret the output as follows:

| Observation | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `startup=idle`, `revision=0` | No startup signal reached the coordinator |
| `stage=market_open` or `market_status`, same Underlying for a long time | A market source call is blocked or serially slow |
| `stage=final`, `revision=0` | Mapping, DataFrame collapse, search catalogue, snapshot copy, or final validation is slow |
| `revision=1`, browser still on cold shell | Browser/Dash handoff or full layout materialization is slow |
| `startup=stalled` | The watchdog fired; the original connector still owns the writer |
| `startup=failed` | The transaction raised and no revision was published |

## 4.1 Diagnose a freeze that happens before `/healthz` exists

If `/healthz` never responds, the Portfolio-expanded DataFrame is not yet the cause: the refresh pipeline has not started. The worker is blocked while importing the application or constructing the WSGI object.

### File: `tools/s05_profile_app_import.py`

Create the file with the following complete content:

```python
"""Import the Cube WSGI application and dump stacks if import construction hangs."""

from __future__ import annotations

import faulthandler
import importlib
import sys
import time
import traceback


def main() -> int:
    faulthandler.enable(all_threads=True)
    faulthandler.dump_traceback_later(
        60.0,
        repeat=True,
        file=sys.stderr,
    )
    started = time.perf_counter()
    try:
        module = importlib.import_module("s01_app")
        server = getattr(module, "server", None)
        if server is None:
            raise RuntimeError(
                "s01_app imported but did not expose server"
            )
    except Exception:
        traceback.print_exc()
        return 1
    finally:
        faulthandler.cancel_dump_traceback_later()

    print(
        "s01_app imported successfully in "
        f"{time.perf_counter() - started:.3f}s"
    )
    return 0


if __name__ == "__main__":
    raise SystemExit(main())
```

Run:

```bash
python tools/s05_profile_app_import.py \
  2> cold-import-stacks.log
```

Also collect Python import timings:

```bash
python -X importtime -c "import s01_app" \
  2> cold-import-times.log
```

Interpretation:

- A stack in `colossus.connect`, MRX, ConfigManager, an HTTP client, or another private SDK means source I/O was accidentally placed at module scope.
- A stack repeatedly importing large optional libraries means the complete recovered import inventory was enabled unnecessarily.
- A successful fast import followed by a stuck `/progressz` stage means the problem is in the refresh pipeline instead of WSGI construction.

The real connector implementation must follow this rule:

```text
Importing s01_app may construct connector callables and clients that perform no
network I/O. The first network call must occur only inside RiskRefreshManager.refresh()
or a page-local Stock load.
```

Do not activate this recovered pattern at module scope:

```python
colossus_connection = colossus.connect("PROD")
```

Section 18 replaces it with a lazy `_real_colossus_connection()` function.

# 5. Make startup begin server-side after the cold page mounts

`StartupCoordinator.schedule_start()` already exists and is idempotent, but the page builders do not use it. Add a delayed server-side start as a fallback. Keep the existing browser interval and `/startz` paths; all paths converge on the same coordinator.

## File: `ui/s09_factory.py`

### Location: immediately after

```python
app.server.config[STARTUP_COORDINATOR_CONFIG_KEY] = startup_coordinator
```

Add:

```python
def schedule_cold_start() -> None:
    """Schedule one delayed writer after a cold financial page is requested."""
    if refresh_manager is None or startup_coordinator is None:
        return
    try:
        revision = int(refresh_manager.health.revision)
    except Exception:
        revision = 0
    if revision <= 0:
        startup_coordinator.schedule_start(delay_seconds=0.5)
```

### Replace `cube_page_body()` with

```python
def cube_page_body() -> html.Main:
    """Mount the revision-aware Risk page and schedule one cold writer."""
    schedule_cold_start()
    return html.Main(current_cube_page(), id="cube-page-container")
```

### Do not make a partial edit to `pnl_page_body()` here

Section 11 contains the complete final replacement for `pnl_page_body()`. That replacement includes:

```python
schedule_cold_start()
```

as its first executable line. Apply that complete replacement when you reach Section 11 rather than editing the same function twice.

Do not call `schedule_cold_start()` from Stock or Statics. Those pages should remain capable of mounting without triggering the entire financial refresh.

---

# 6. Build the shared hero in cold-loading mode immediately

## File: `ui/s09_factory.py`

### Function: `serve_layout()`

At the start of the function add:

```python
shared_snapshot = current_shared_snapshot()
cold_start = (
    refresh_manager is not None
    and shared_snapshot is None
)
```

Replace the existing `build_shared_refresh_shell(...)` call with:

```python
build_shared_refresh_shell(
    shared_snapshot,
    refresh_enabled=refresh_manager is not None,
    stage_delays=stage_delays,
    initial_loading=cold_start,
    keep_polling=cold_start,
    # A cold root page must paint the hero before the navigation callback runs.
    # Stock and Statics will hide it immediately through update_navigation().
    style={} if cold_start else {"display": "none"},
),
```

Do not call `current_shared_snapshot()` again inside this shell call.

---

# 7. Preserve the hero until the financial page consumes revision 1

The current callback uses the committed revision marker as though it were the page-rendered revision. Separate those values.

## File: `ui/s07_events.py`

### Replace the complete `hydrate_shared_refresh_shell` callback decorator and function with

```python
@app.callback(
    Output("shared-refresh-shell", "children"),

# 8. Leave a completed hero visible long enough to paint

## File: `assets/s02_app.js`

### Function: `finishRefreshProgress()`

Replace:

```javascript
}, hasNewError ? 5000 : 300);
```

with:

```javascript
}, hasNewError ? 5000 : 1500);
```

This is presentation polish. The Python handoff changes above are the actual lifecycle fix.

### Function: `recoverReadyBootstrap()`

Replace:

```javascript
const handoffDeadline = Date.now() + 15000;
```

with:

```javascript
const handoffDeadline = Date.now() + 60000;
```

Keep the existing session-scoped one-reload guard. This gives a large first React/Dash tree up to one minute to mount before the browser attempts its single recovery reload.

# 9. Add a targeted dashboard read so startup does not copy every large frame

The current `refresh_manager.snapshot` property deep-copies Risk status, Risk checker, combined P&L, MarketBook, dashboard, unmapped rows, and dictionaries. The cold Risk page only needs the compact control metadata and `dashboard_frame`.

## File: `core/s02_pipeline.py`

### Location: immediately after the existing `FrameRead` dataclass

Add:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class DashboardRead:
    """One dashboard frame and compact controls from the same committed revision."""

    revision: int
    control: ControlSnapshot
    frame: pd.DataFrame
```

### Inside `RiskRefreshManager`, replace the existing `control_snapshot` property with the following block and add `read_dashboard()` immediately below it

```python
@staticmethod
def _control_from_snapshot(committed: RefreshSnapshot) -> ControlSnapshot:
    return ControlSnapshot(
        revision=committed.revision,
        refreshed_at=committed.refreshed_at,
        system_date=committed.system_date,
        market_date=committed.market_date,
        checker_date=committed.checker_date,
        market_status=committed.market_status,
        forced_view_date=committed.forced_view_date,
        risk_status=committed.risk_status.copy(deep=True),
        risk_checker_enabled=committed.risk_checker_enabled,
        commodity_market_enabled=committed.commodity_market_enabled,
        risk_dates=dict(committed.risk_dates),
        forced_dates=dict(committed.forced_dates),
        errors=committed.errors,
    )

@property

    )
```

### In `core/s02_pipeline.py::__all__` add

```python
"DashboardRead",
```

## File: `ui/s01_contracts.py`

### Add after `FrameReadProtocol`

```python

    @property
    def frame(self) -> pd.DataFrame: ...
```

### In `RefreshManagerProtocol` add

```python
def read_dashboard(self) -> DashboardReadProtocol: ...
```

### In `__all__` add

```python
"DashboardReadProtocol",
```

## File: `ui/s09_factory.py`

Delete these variables from `build_app()`:

```python
risk_snapshot_lock = Lock()
risk_snapshot_revision = prepared_dashboard_revision
risk_snapshot_cache = initial_snapshot
```

Replace `current_cube_page()` with:

```python
def current_cube_page():
    """Serve the shell cold and the complete dashboard after revision 1."""
    if refresh_manager is not None:
        try:
            if int(refresh_manager.health.revision) > 0:

        include_shared_refresh_shell=False,
    )
```

## File: `ui/s07_events.py`

Replace `materialize_initial_dashboard()` with:

```python
def materialize_initial_dashboard() -> html.Div:
    """Build the full page from a targeted same-revision dashboard read."""
    try:
        dashboard_read = refresh_manager.read_dashboard()

            dashboard_read.revision,
        )
        layout = build_layout(
            prepared,

            incident_id,
            type(error).__name__,
            exc_info=True,
        )
        safe_error = (
            f"Dashboard preparation failed (incident {incident_id}). "
            "No dashboard was published; retry after checking the server log."
        )

        return build_initial_load_layout(

        )
    app.server.config[STARTUP_UI_ERROR_CONFIG_KEY] = None
    return layout
```

In `load_initial_snapshot_after_first_paint()`, replace:

```python
return materialize_initial_dashboard(refresh_manager.snapshot)
```

with:

```python
return materialize_initial_dashboard()
```

## File: `ui/s04_components.py`

Change the `build_layout()` parameter annotation from:

```python
initial_snapshot: RefreshSnapshotProtocol | None = None,
```

into:

```python
initial_snapshot: (
    ControlSnapshotProtocol | RefreshSnapshotProtocol | None
) = None,
```

Also change the first parameter annotation of `build_risk_date_editor()` from:

```python
snapshot: RefreshSnapshotProtocol,
```

to:

```python
snapshot: ControlSnapshotProtocol | RefreshSnapshotProtocol,
```

---

## 9.1 Reuse the factory's prepared dashboard cache inside Risk callbacks

Without this change, `prepared_committed_dashboard()` and `_RiskDataCache.replace_frame()` can both call `prepare_risk_data()` for the same committed revision. Use the factory cache as the one preparation authority.

### File: `ui/s07_events.py`

### Replace `_RiskDataCache.__init__()` with

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    risk_data: pd.DataFrame,
    revision: int,
    *,
    prepared_frame_loader: Callable[..., pd.DataFrame | None] | None = None,
) -> None:
    self._lock = RLock()
    self._revision = int(revision)
    self._frame = risk_data
    self._prepared_frame_loader = prepared_frame_loader
    self._filtered: dict[tuple[Any, ...], pd.DataFrame] = {}
    self._rendered: OrderedDict[str, Any] = OrderedDict()
```

The module already imports `Callable` and `Any`.

### Replace `_RiskDataCache.replace_frame()` completely

```python
def replace_frame(
    self,
    frame: pd.DataFrame,
    revision: int,
) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Publish one prepared dashboard frame to the callback cache."""
    selected_revision = int(revision)

    if self._prepared_frame_loader is None:
        prepared = prepare_risk_data(frame)
    else:
        prepared = self._prepared_frame_loader(
            revision=selected_revision,
            frame=frame,
        )
        if prepared is None:
            raise RuntimeError(
                "Prepared dashboard frame is unavailable"
            )

    with self._lock:
        if selected_revision <= self._revision:
            return self._frame

        self._frame = prepared
        self._revision = selected_revision
        self._filtered.clear()
        self._rendered.clear()
        return prepared
```

### Add a parameter to `register_callbacks()`

Add after `market_history_loader`:

```python
prepared_frame_loader: (
    Callable[..., pd.DataFrame | None] | None
) = None,
```

The end of the signature becomes:

```python
def register_callbacks(
    app: Dash,
    refresh_manager: RefreshManagerProtocol | None,
    initial_snapshot: RefreshSnapshotProtocol | None,
    risk_data: pd.DataFrame,
    *,
    route_prefix: str = "/",
    startup_coordinator: StartupCoordinator | None = None,
    market_history_loader: MarketHistoryLoaderProtocol | None = None,
    prepared_frame_loader: (
        Callable[..., pd.DataFrame | None] | None
    ) = None,
) -> None:
```

### Replace the `_RiskDataCache` construction

Replace:

```python
cache = _RiskDataCache(
    risk_data,
    initial_snapshot.revision
    if initial_snapshot is not None
    else 0,
)
```

with:

```python
cache = _RiskDataCache(
    risk_data,
    initial_snapshot.revision
    if initial_snapshot is not None
    else 0,
    prepared_frame_loader=prepared_frame_loader,
)
```

### File: `ui/s09_factory.py`

### Add the loader to the existing `register_callbacks()` call

Replace that complete call with:

```python
register_callbacks(
    app,
    refresh_manager,
    initial_snapshot,
    risk_data,
    route_prefix=request_prefix,
    startup_coordinator=startup_coordinator,
    market_history_loader=market_history_loader,
    prepared_frame_loader=prepared_committed_dashboard,
)
```

After this change, the first caller that requests a revision prepares it; later Risk and P&L consumers receive the same process-local prepared frame.

---

# 10. Avoid the defensive full-snapshot copy that cold startup discards

The startup coordinator ignores the object returned by `RiskRefreshManager.refresh()`. Add an opt-out that retains the existing safe default for every normal caller.

## File: `core/s02_pipeline.py`

### In the `RiskRefreshManager.refresh()` signature add

```python
copy_result: bool = True,
```

The end of the signature should look like:

```python
def refresh(
    self,
    *,
    force_pl: bool = False,
    force_risk: bool = False,
    commodity_market_enabled: bool = False,
    risk_checker_enabled: bool | None = None,
    forced_dates: Mapping[
        str,
        date | datetime | str | pd.Timestamp,
    ] | None = None,
    view_date: date | datetime | str | pd.Timestamp | None = None,
    reason: str = "status",
    expected_revision: int | None = None,
    copy_result: bool = True,
) -> RefreshSnapshot:
```

At the beginning of the method add:

```python
if not isinstance(copy_result, bool):
    raise TypeError("copy_result must be boolean")


def release_result(snapshot: RefreshSnapshot) -> RefreshSnapshot:
    return self._copy_snapshot(snapshot) if copy_result else snapshot
```

Within `refresh()` only, replace every occurrence of:

```python
return self._copy_snapshot(snapshot)
```

with:

```python
return release_result(snapshot)
```

Do not change `refresh_portfolios()` in this step.

## File: `ui/s01_contracts.py`

Add the optional parameter to the protocol method:

```python
copy_result: bool = True,
```

## File: `ui/s07_events.py`

### Function: `StartupCoordinator._run()`

Replace the direct manager call with this compatibility-safe block:

```python
refresh_kwargs: dict[str, object] = {
    "forced_dates": {},
    "view_date": None,
    "commodity_market_enabled": False,
    "risk_checker_enabled": True,
    "reason": "initial load",
    "expected_revision": 0,
}
try:
    parameters = signature(self._manager.refresh).parameters
except (TypeError, ValueError):
    parameters = {}
if "copy_result" in parameters:
    refresh_kwargs["copy_result"] = False

self._manager.refresh(**refresh_kwargs)
```

This removes one full copy of `combined_pl`, `market_frame`, `dashboard_frame`, `unmapped_frame`, `risk_checker`, and `risk_status` from the cold-start critical path.

---

# 11. Remove duplicate initial Risk and P&L table construction

## File: `ui/s04_components.py`

### Function: `build_layout()`

Keep:

```python
initial_risk_type = risk_options[0]["value"]
top_book_open_rows = default_top_book_open_rows(risk_data)
```

Delete the entire block that creates:

```python
initial_ir_family
initial_risk_frame
initial_open_rows
initial_risk_table
initial_aggregate_table
```

In the `aggregate-pl-grid` component, replace `initial_aggregate_table` with:

```python
html.Div(
    "Loading Aggregate P&L…",
    className="empty-state",
    role="status",
)
```

The block should become:

```python
html.Div(
    dcc.Loading(
        html.Div(
            html.Div(
                "Loading Aggregate P&L…",
                className="empty-state",
                role="status",
            ),
            id="aggregate-pl-grid",
        ),
        custom_spinner=build_cube_loader("Loading aggregate P&L"),
        delay_show=120,
        className="cube-loading-boundary",
    ),
    className="aggregate-pl-panel",
),
```

In `risk-grid`, replace `initial_risk_table` with:

```python
html.Div(
    "Loading Risk Explorer…",
    className="empty-state",
    role="status",
)
```

The block should become:

```python
html.Div(
    html.Div(
        html.Div(
            "Loading Risk Explorer…",
            className="empty-state",
            role="status",
        ),
        id="risk-grid",
        className="risk-grid",
    ),
    id="main-risk-panel",
    className="risk-panel",
),
```

The existing mounted callbacks remain the sole builders of the two expensive tables.

## File: `ui/s09_factory.py`

Replace `pnl_page_body()` with:

```python
def pnl_page_body():
    """Mount Aggregate P&L and the optional sender on the native P&L route."""
    schedule_cold_start()
    if refresh_manager is not None:
        try:
            start_initial_load = int(refresh_manager.health.revision) <= 0
        except Exception:
            start_initial_load = True
            app.logger.exception("Could not read the P&L startup revision")

        return build_pl_page(
            start_initial_load=start_initial_load,
            send_workflow_available=pl_send_config is not None,
            initial_aggregate_frame=None,
            saved_view_bar=build_saved_filter_view_bar(
                PL_SAVED_VIEW_CONTROLS,
                filter_note=PL_FILTER_NOTE,
                filter_bar=build_pl_filter_bar(None),
            ),
        )

    return html.Main(
        [
            html.H1("P&L Sender", className="static-data-page-title"),
            html.P(
                "P&L sending is not configured for this application.",
                id="pnl-unavailable",
                className="static-data-empty",
            ),
        ],
        id="pnl-page",
        className="static-data-page",
    )
```

Do not delete `prepared_committed_dashboard()`. Other callbacks still use its revision cache.

---

# 12. Remove the intentional one-second Risk product delay

## File: `s01_app.py`

Replace:

```python
"risk_product": float(os.getenv("RISK_PRODUCT_DELAY_SECONDS", "1")),
```

with:

```python
"risk_product": float(os.getenv("RISK_PRODUCT_DELAY_SECONDS", "0")),
```

This delay is not applied on the first cold snapshot, but it unnecessarily slows every later Risk reload and date-driven Risk refresh.

---

---

# 13. Add bounded connector task workers inside the one process

This is the correct place to use multiple workers for real market data and the active fake synchronous connector path.

The same manager methods call whichever adapter is registered:

- fake CSV connectors in the checked-in runtime; or
- real product adapters after the registration switch.

Therefore this change exercises the same concurrency path in both environments.

Keep the checked-in fake connector deterministic:

```text
CUBE_RISK_CONNECTOR_WORKERS=1
CUBE_MARKET_CONNECTOR_WORKERS=1
CUBE_CONNECTOR_BATCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=300
```

After activating the real adapters and confirming client thread safety and API rate limits, start with:

```text
CUBE_RISK_CONNECTOR_WORKERS=2
CUBE_MARKET_CONNECTOR_WORKERS=4
```

Then benchmark Risk `4` and Market `8`, changing one value at a time.

## File: `core/s02_pipeline.py`

### Add these imports near the top

```python
from concurrent.futures import (
    Future,
    ThreadPoolExecutor,
    TimeoutError as FuturesTimeoutError,
    as_completed,
)
```

### Add these parameters to `RiskRefreshManager.__init__()`

Place them after `stage_delays`:

```python
risk_workers: int = 1,
market_workers: int = 1,
connector_batch_timeout_seconds: float = 300.0,
```

### Add this validation inside `__init__()` before assigning instance fields

```python
for name, value in (
    ("risk_workers", risk_workers),
    ("market_workers", market_workers),
):
    if isinstance(value, (bool, np.bool_)) or not isinstance(value, int):
        raise TypeError(f"{name} must be a positive integer")
    if value <= 0:
        raise ValueError(f"{name} must be greater than zero")

if isinstance(
    connector_batch_timeout_seconds,
    (bool, np.bool_),
) or not isinstance(connector_batch_timeout_seconds, Real):
    raise TypeError(
        "connector_batch_timeout_seconds must be a positive real number"
    )
connector_timeout = float(connector_batch_timeout_seconds)
if not np.isfinite(connector_timeout) or connector_timeout <= 0:
    raise ValueError(
        "connector_batch_timeout_seconds must be a positive finite number"
    )
```

### Add these assignments after the existing loader assignments

```python
self._risk_workers = int(risk_workers)
self._market_workers = int(market_workers)
self._connector_batch_timeout_seconds = connector_timeout
self._risk_executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(
    max_workers=self._risk_workers,
    thread_name_prefix="cube-risk-source",
)
self._market_executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(
    max_workers=self._market_workers,
    thread_name_prefix="cube-market-source",
)
```

The executors are bounded and process-local. Their threads are created lazily when the first task is submitted.

### Add this method inside `RiskRefreshManager`, immediately before `_load_product_risk()`

```python
def _collect_connector_frames(
    self,
    future_map: Mapping[Future, tuple[int, str]],
    *,
    function_name: str,
    stage: str,
    source_type: str | None,
    unit_name: str,
) -> list[pd.DataFrame]:
    """Collect one bounded connector batch in deterministic input order."""
    if not future_map:
        return []

    ordered: list[pd.DataFrame | None] = [None] * len(future_map)
    try:
        completed = 0
        for future in as_completed(
            tuple(future_map),
            timeout=self._connector_batch_timeout_seconds,
        ):
            position, label = future_map[future]
            frame = future.result()
            if not isinstance(frame, pd.DataFrame):
                raise TypeError(
                    f"{function_name} returned a non-DataFrame for {label!r}"
                )
            ordered[position] = frame
            completed += 1

            progress_values: dict[str, object] = {}
            if unit_name == "Underlying":
                progress_values["underlying"] = label
            else:
                progress_values["product_label"] = label

            self._progress_activity(
                function_name,
                stage,
                source_type=source_type,
                product_index=completed,
                product_total=len(future_map),
                message=(
                    f"Completed {unit_name} {completed} of "
                    f"{len(future_map)}: {label}."
                ),
                **progress_values,
            )
    except FuturesTimeoutError as exc:
        pending_labels = [
            label
            for future, (_position, label) in future_map.items()
            if not future.done()
        ]
        for future in future_map:
            future.cancel()
        self._progress_activity(
            function_name,
            stage,
            source_type=source_type,
            message=(
                f"Connector batch exceeded "
                f"{self._connector_batch_timeout_seconds:g}s; "
                f"pending={pending_labels[:10]}."
            ),
        )
        raise TimeoutError(
            f"{function_name} exceeded the connector batch timeout; "
            f"pending={pending_labels[:10]}"
        ) from exc
    except Exception:
        for future in future_map:
            future.cancel()
        raise

    if any(frame is None for frame in ordered):
        raise RuntimeError(f"{function_name} did not complete every submitted task")
    return [frame for frame in ordered if frame is not None]
```

A Python thread cannot forcibly terminate an arbitrary blocked synchronous library call. The batch timeout makes the refresh fail visibly and cancels queued tasks, but every real client must still have its own socket/request/database timeout configured. The executor is persistent and bounded, so a blocked call cannot create an unbounded number of new framework threads.

# 14. Parallelize independent Risk product source calls

Keep fake mode at `CUBE_RISK_CONNECTOR_WORKERS=1`. In real mode begin with `2`. Set it back to `1` if the private client library uses a shared mutable session.

## File: `core/s02_pipeline.py`

### Replace `_load_product_risk()` with

```python
def _load_product_risk(
    self,
    spec: ProductSpec,
    risk_date: pd.Timestamp,
    *,
    product_index: int = 0,
    product_total: int = 0,
) -> pd.DataFrame:

# 16. Pass connector worker settings from the feed composition root

## File: `feeds/s01_sources.py`

### Add these helpers immediately above `build_production_refresh_manager()`

```python
def _positive_int_env(name: str, default: int) -> int:
    raw = os.getenv(name, str(default))
    try:
        value = int(raw)
    except (TypeError, ValueError) as exc:
        raise ValueError(f"{name} must be a positive integer") from exc
    if value <= 0:
        raise ValueError(f"{name} must be greater than zero")
    return value


def _positive_float_env(name: str, default: float) -> float:
    raw = os.getenv(name, str(default))
    try:
        value = float(raw)
    except (TypeError, ValueError) as exc:
        raise ValueError(f"{name} must be a positive number") from exc
    if not np.isfinite(value) or value <= 0:
        raise ValueError(f"{name} must be a positive finite number")
    return value
```

Because `_positive_float_env` uses NumPy, add this active import near the top:

```python
import numpy as np
```

### Inside `build_production_refresh_manager()` add

```python
risk_workers = _positive_int_env(
    "CUBE_RISK_CONNECTOR_WORKERS",
    1,
)
market_workers = _positive_int_env(
    "CUBE_MARKET_CONNECTOR_WORKERS",
    1,
)
connector_timeout = _positive_float_env(
    "CUBE_CONNECTOR_BATCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS",
    300.0,
)
```

### Add these arguments to the `RiskRefreshManager(...)` call

```python
risk_workers=risk_workers,
market_workers=market_workers,
connector_batch_timeout_seconds=connector_timeout,
```

The final call should contain:

```python
return RiskRefreshManager(
    get_portfolio_config,
    thresholds=get_risk_thresholds,
    reported_underlyings=get_reported_underlyings,
    risk_checker_loader=get_risk_checker,
    market_status_resolver=resolve_market_state,
    risk_loader=get_risk,
    cross_gamma_matrix_loader=get_cross_gamma_sensitivities,
    new_trades_loader=get_new_trades,
    market_open_loader=get_market_open,
    market_status_loader=get_market_status,
    connector_adapters=get_product_connector_adapters(),
    stage_delays=stage_delays,
    trading_timezone=trading_timezone,
    risk_workers=risk_workers,
    market_workers=market_workers,
    connector_batch_timeout_seconds=connector_timeout,
)
```

# 17. Replace the recovered single-worker async bridge

The recovered `run_async` uses `ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=1)`. If the real adapters are enabled unchanged, all qcd/RAMP coroutines pass through one serialized thread. Replace it with one lazily started event loop that accepts many thread-safe coroutine submissions.

## File: `adapters/s01_common.py`

Keep the existing active schema helper functions, but add the following active imports after `from __future__ import annotations`:

```python
import asyncio
import os
from concurrent.futures import TimeoutError as FutureTimeoutError
from threading import Event, Lock, Thread
from typing import Any, Protocol
```

Remove the existing active line:

```python
from typing import Protocol
```

because `Protocol` is imported in the combined import above.

### Add this block before `class RiskSource`

```python
_ASYNC_LOOP_LOCK = Lock()

_ASYNC_LOOP_THREAD: Thread | None = None


def _async_timeout_seconds() -> float:

            "CUBE_ASYNC_CONNECTOR_TIMEOUT_SECONDS must be a positive number"
        ) from exc
    if timeout <= 0:
        raise ValueError(
            "CUBE_ASYNC_CONNECTOR_TIMEOUT_SECONDS must be greater than zero"

            and _ASYNC_LOOP_THREAD.is_alive()
        ):

        )
        thread.start()
        if not ready.wait(timeout=5.0):
            raise RuntimeError("Cube async connector loop did not start")

        _ASYNC_LOOP = loop
        _ASYNC_LOOP_THREAD = thread
        return loop


def run_async(
    coro: Any,
    *,
    timeout_seconds: float | None = None,
) -> Any:
    """Submit one coroutine to the shared connector event loop."""
    if not asyncio.iscoroutine(coro):
        raise TypeError("run_async expects a coroutine object")

    timeout = (
        _async_timeout_seconds()
        if timeout_seconds is None
        else float(timeout_seconds)
    )
    if timeout <= 0:
        raise ValueError("timeout_seconds must be greater than zero")

    future = asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(
        coro,
        _ensure_async_loop(),
    )
    try:
        return future.result(timeout=timeout)
    except FutureTimeoutError as exc:
        future.cancel()
        raise TimeoutError(
            f"Async connector exceeded {timeout:g} seconds"
        ) from exc
```

### Add `run_async` to `__all__`

```python
__all__ = [
    "MarketSource",
    "RiskSource",
    "exact_frame",
    "exact_status",
    "exact_underlying",
    "market_frame",
    "run_async",
]
```

Why this design:

- the manager's market task threads can call `run_async` concurrently;
- all coroutines are scheduled thread-safely on one event loop;
- while one coroutine awaits network I/O, the loop can run the others;
- each wait has a finite timeout;
- no nested submission waits on the same one-worker executor.

A coroutine must still use genuinely asynchronous I/O. CPU-heavy work inside an `async def` function will block this event loop and must remain outside it.

# 18. Parallelize the three independent real Portfolio sources

The recovered Portfolio mapping fetches Colossus, ConfigManager, and MRX sequentially. Fetch them concurrently, then merge them in one deterministic main-thread step.

_business_date(

selected_date = pd.Timestamp(portfolio_date).normalize()

if _env_enabled("CUBE_USE_REAL_PORTFOLIO_CONFIG"):

        != PORTFOLIO_FIELD_BY_KEY["product"].external_name
    ],
    dataset="portfolio_config",
)
return frame.copy(deep=True)
```

Immediately after the function definition add:

```python
get_portfolio_config.cache_clear = (  # type: ignore[attr-defined]
    clear_portfolio_config_cache
)
```

### Configure real-client I/O timeouts

The framework batch timeout prevents the refresh from waiting forever at the orchestration level, but a running Python thread cannot be killed safely. Configure finite timeouts in the actual private clients as well:

- Colossus HTTP request timeout.
- ConfigManager request timeout.
- MRX fetch timeout.
- qcd/RAMP coroutine timeout through `run_async`.

Do not leave any remote call with an infinite socket wait.

# 19. Clear the Portfolio cache only for an explicit Portfolio/force refresh

A date-keyed cache avoids refetching the same governance during normal callbacks and Stock loads. The Refresh Portfolios button must still bypass it.

## File: `core/s02_pipeline.py`

### Add this module helper near `_load_portfolio_config()`

```python
def _clear_source_cache(source: object) -> None:
    """Clear an optional connector-owned cache without importing its module."""
    cache_clear = getattr(source, "cache_clear", None)
    if callable(cache_clear):
        cache_clear()
```

### In `refresh_portfolios()`, immediately before `_load_portfolio_config(...)`, add

```python
_clear_source_cache(self._config_source)
```

The block should become:

```python
_clear_source_cache(self._config_source)
next_config = _load_portfolio_config(
    self._config_source,
    portfolio_date,
)
```

### In `refresh()`, within the final block, replace

```python
if force_risk or market_date_changed or base_config is None:
    portfolio_date = checker_date
    next_config = _load_portfolio_config(
        self._config_source, portfolio_date
    )
```

with:

```python
if force_risk or market_date_changed or base_config is None:
    portfolio_date = checker_date
    if force_risk:
        _clear_source_cache(self._config_source)
    next_config = _load_portfolio_config(
        self._config_source,
        portfolio_date,
    )
```

# 20. Do not add generic “async CSV reads”

The active fixture path already caches parsed files and per-Source/Underlying partitions. `pandas.read_csv()` is blocking; wrapping it in `async def` does not make it asynchronous.

The manager-level connector task pool above already allows the synchronous fake connector functions to run through the same bounded task path as the real connectors. That is sufficient for integration testing.

Only optimize the remaining repeated `Path.stat()` calls if profiling shows the files are on slow network storage. On a local filesystem this is below the priority of Portfolio collapse, source concurrency, snapshot copying, and duplicate rendering.

# 21. Collapse Portfolio before publishing `dashboard_frame`

This is the primary row-count reduction. Keep Portfolio in raw connectors, `combined_pl`, mapping, diagnostics, Stock enrichment, and Portfolio P&L sending. Remove it only from the analytical frame published to Dash.

- Open and Current: mean.
- Move: recalculate from the averaged quotes.
- All-missing additive values: remain missing.
- Rows collapse only when their remaining reporting metadata and market identity agree.

The existing `_validate_dashboard_release()` is already Portfolio-free at its release grain and does not require the raw Portfolio column.

# 22. Remove Portfolio from the governed UI selector registry

## File: `ui/s02_constants.py`

### Replace the import

```python
from core.s01_schema import PORTFOLIO_COLUMN, PORTFOLIO_FIELDS, PortfolioField
```

with:

```python
from core.s01_schema import PORTFOLIO_FIELDS
```

### Replace the complete block from `PORTFOLIO_UI_FIELD = ...` through `FILTER_DIMENSION_FIELDS = ...` with

```python
VIEW_DIMENSION_FIELDS = tuple(
    field
    for field in PORTFOLIO_FIELDS
    if "view_dimension" in field.roles
)

FILTER_DIMENSION_FIELDS = tuple(
    field
    for field in PORTFOLIO_FIELDS
    if "filter_dimension" in field.roles
)

FILTER_DIMENSION_ORDER = tuple(
    field.key
    for field in FILTER_DIMENSION_FIELDS
)
```

Delete `PORTFOLIO_UI_FIELD` from `__all__` if it is exported later in the file.

After this change:

- View by: Product, Activity, Signoff Group, Category, Sub Category.
- Filters: Activity, Signoff Group, Category, Sub Category.
- Default view: Activity.

# 23. Remove Portfolio from Quick Search

The Search catalogue currently requires Portfolio. It must be changed in the same patch as `dashboard_frame`, otherwise revision 1 will fail during final catalogue construction.

## File: `core/s03_search.py`

### Remove `PORTFOLIO_COLUMN` from the `core.s01_schema` import

Delete:

```python
PORTFOLIO_COLUMN,
```

Delete:

```python
PORTFOLIO = PORTFOLIO_COLUMN
```

### Replace `PIVOT_INDEX_COLUMNS`, `GOVERNANCE_COLUMNS`, and `RISK_ONLY_INDEX_COLUMNS` with

```python
PIVOT_INDEX_COLUMNS = (
    SOURCE_TYPE,
    RISK_TYPE,
    RISK_GREEK,
    REPORTED_UNDERLYING,
    UNDERLYING,
    *TENOR_COLUMNS,
    *PORTFOLIO_METADATA_COLUMNS,
)
GOVERNANCE_COLUMNS = tuple(PORTFOLIO_METADATA_COLUMNS)
RISK_ONLY_INDEX_COLUMNS = (
    REPORTED_UNDERLYING,
    *GOVERNANCE_COLUMNS,
)
```

### Replace `QUICK_RISK_FILTER_COLUMNS` with

```python
QUICK_RISK_FILTER_COLUMNS = (
    SPLIT,
    *(
        field.external_name
        for field in PORTFOLIO_FIELDS
        if "filter_dimension" in field.roles
    ),
)
```

### In `_risk_pivot_catalog_frame()`, replace `required` with

```python
required = [
    SOURCE_TYPE,
    RISK_TYPE,
    RISK_GREEK,
    UNDERLYING,
    *RISK_PIVOT_VALUE_COLUMNS,
]
```

### In `build_search_catalog()`, delete

```python
fallback[PORTFOLIO] = UNSPECIFIED
```

## File: `ui/s04_components.py`

In `_QUICK_SEARCH_IDENTITY_OPTIONS`, delete:

```python
("Portfolio", "Portfolio"),
```

Update `RISK_FILTER_NOTE` to:

```python
RISK_FILTER_NOTE = (
    "Include mode uses OR within one populated filter and AND across "
    "populated filters. Exclude mode removes rows matching any selected "
    "value. Leave a filter blank for all values; Risk selections remain "
    "independent from Stock and P&L."
)
```

# 24. Remove the Portfolio-specific unmapped-books callback dependency

## File: `ui/s07_events.py`

Delete the complete `filter_unmapped_portfolios()` function and remove its name from `__all__`.

Then, inside the callback that renders `unmapped-books-grid`, delete this call:

```python
frame = filter_unmapped_portfolios(
    frame,
    selected_portfolios,
    exclude_selected=risk_exclude_selected(
        exclude_value
    ),
)
```

Find the callback that renders `unmapped-books-grid`.

Remove these inputs:

```python
Input(DIMENSION_FILTER_IDS["portfolio"], "value"),
Input("risk-filter-exclude-selected", "value"),
```

Change the function signature from:

```python
def render_unmapped_books(
    _summary_clicks,
    _revision,
    selected_portfolios,
    exclude_value,
    is_open,
):
```

into:

```python
def render_unmapped_books(
    _summary_clicks,
    _revision,
    is_open,
):
```

Delete the call to `filter_unmapped_portfolios(...)`.

The unmapped diagnostic table may continue displaying Portfolio because Portfolio is the identity of an unmapped book. It is no longer an analytical page filter.

---

# 25. Make P&L history callbacks independent of the number of filters

## File: `ui/s08_plevents.py`

### Replace the `render_historical_pl_hierarchy()` signature and first lines with

```python
def render_historical_pl_hierarchy(
    summary_clicks,
    _row_clicks,
    _period_header_clicks,
    _metric_clicks,
    *args,

        open_path_tokens,
        open_comparison_tokens,
        selection_state,
    ) = args[filter_count + 1:]
```

Replace the hard-coded `pl_external_filter_map([...])` call with:

```python
page_filters = pl_external_filter_map(filter_values)
```

### Replace the `render_historical_pl_chart()` signature and first lines with

```python
def render_historical_pl_chart(
    selection_state,
    series_choice,
    *args,
):
    """Plot observed Colossus/Predict rows for the selected hierarchy scope."""
    filter_count = len(PL_FILTER_FIELDS)

        _ytd_clicks,
        _all_clicks,
        explicit_start,
        explicit_end,
        range_state,
    ) = args[filter_count + 1:]
```

Replace its hard-coded `pl_external_filter_map([...])` call with:

```python
pl_external_filter_map(filter_values)
```

## File: `ui/s06_plview.py`

Change:

```python
"""Build the single authoritative five-field P&L filter row."""
```

into:

```python
"""Build the configured P&L filter row."""
```

## File: `ui/s14_pl_filters.py`

Change any docstring referring to five selectors into:

```python
"""Normalize the configured P&L selectors to external columns."""
```

---

# 26. Migrate saved views from five filters to four

The saved-view repository requires exact filter-key equality. Existing JSON files containing `portfolio` will otherwise be rejected.

Create a one-use script outside the application, or run this from the repository root during deployment:

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path


for path in Path("data/saved_views").rglob("*.json"):
    payload = json.loads(
        path.read_text(encoding="utf-8")
    )
    payload["filters"].pop("portfolio", None)
    path.write_text(
        json.dumps(payload, indent=2) + "\n",
        encoding="utf-8",
    )
```

No change is needed inside `core/s08_saved_views.py`.

## File: `assets/s01_style.css`

Replace:

```css
grid-template-columns: repeat(5, minmax(120px, 1fr));
```

with:

```css
grid-template-columns: repeat(4, minmax(120px, 1fr));
```

---

# 27. Allow partially populated Credit measures

The repository uses the name `PSP01`, not `PSP`.

## File: `core/s02_pipeline.py`

### Function: `get_product_risk()`

Replace:

```python
if credit_measure_columns:
    frame = _coerce_numeric(
        frame,
        credit_measure_columns,
        f"{spec.key} optional Credit measures",
    )
```

with:

```python
if credit_measure_columns:
    frame[credit_measure_columns] = frame[
        credit_measure_columns
    ].apply(
        pd.to_numeric,
        errors="raise",
    )
```

Leave mandatory Risk and dRisk coercion unchanged.

## File: `ui/s03_aggregate.py`

### Function: `credit_measure_available()`

Change:

```python
connector_rows[column].notna().all()
```

into:

```python
connector_rows[column].notna().any()
```

### Function: `credit_measure_values()`

Replace:

```python

Update the docstrings from “complete connector measure” to “available connector measure”.

Do not fill missing Credit values with zero. Existing sums use `min_count=1`.

# 28. Move the natural tenor sorter into the core schema

## File: `core/s01_schema.py`

Add:

```python
import re
```

Immediately after `TENOR_ORDER_BY_COLUMN`, add:

```python
def tenor_sort_key(value: object) -> tuple[int, float, str]:
    """Sort common tenor labels while retaining unfamiliar valid values."""
    label = str(value).strip()
    upper = label.upper()
    if upper == "SPOT":
        return (-2, 0.0, upper)
    if upper in {"ON", "O/N"}:
        return (-1, 0.0, upper)
    if upper in {"", "N/A", "NA", "UNSPECIFIED"}:
        return (2, float("inf"), upper)
    match = re.search(
        r"(?:^|[\s\-_ /])(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\s*([DMY])$",
        upper,
    )
    if match:
        number = float(match.group(1))
        days = number * {
            "D": 1.0,
            "M": 30.4375,

        }[match.group(2)]
        return (0, days, upper)
    return (1, float("inf"), upper)
```

Add to `__all__`:

```python
"tenor_sort_key",
```

## File: `ui/s03_aggregate.py`

Delete:

```python
import re
```

Delete the local `tenor_sort_key()` function.

Replace:

```python
from core.s01_schema import PORTFOLIO_FIELDS
```

with:

```python
from core.s01_schema import PORTFOLIO_FIELDS, tenor_sort_key
```

## File: `core/s02_pipeline.py`

Add `tenor_sort_key` to the `core.s01_schema` import.

# 29. Normalize conflicting or missing tenor orders instead of rejecting them

The policy is:

1. Use the lowest supplied rank for each tenor label.
2. Sort labels by supplied rank.
3. Break collisions with `tenor_sort_key`.
4. Put labels with no supplied rank after ranked labels.
5. Renumber the final order as `0, 1, 2, ...`.
6. Never discard a tenor because its supplied rank conflicts.

# 31. Display Open, Current, and Move at Reported Underlying

The quote hierarchy already deduplicates repeated quote identities and calculates equal-weight market values. The display rule currently hides those values at Reported Underlying.

## File: `ui/s03_aggregate.py`

### Function: `should_show_sum()`

Replace:

```python
if column in {"move", "open", "current"}:
    return _is_semantic_underlying(context)
```

with:

```python
if column in {"move", "open", "current"}:
    return (
        "reported underlying" in context
        or _is_semantic_underlying(context)

# 32. Replace the custom Stock hierarchy with a P&L-style Aggregate Stock page

The existing Stock page maintains a custom hierarchy, promotion threshold, temporary currency grouping, JSON path tokens, and open-row state. That machinery is not required for the requested page.

The replacement keeps:

- current and prior date controls;
- saved views;
- the four governed reporting filters;
- mapped/unmapped counters;
- lazy detailed comparison rows.

It replaces the hierarchy with:

- an always-visible **Aggregate Stock** section;
- the same governed **View by** choices as Aggregate P&L;
- Prior Quantity, Current Quantity, Quantity Change;
- Prior Market Value, Current Market Value, Market Value Change.

Portfolio remains in the raw Stock connector and mapping join, but it is removed before the public Stock page receives the mapped comparison.

## 32.1 Aggregate duplicate raw Stock rows instead of rejecting them

### File: `core/s07_stock.py`

### Add immediately before `compare_stock_snapshots()`

```python
def _aggregate_stock_snapshot(

            observed=True,
        )[list(STOCK_NUMERIC_COLUMNS)]
        .sum(min_count=1)
    )
```

### Replace the first four lines inside `compare_stock_snapshots()`

Replace:

```python
current = validate_stock_frame(current_stock, label="Current Stock")
prior = validate_stock_frame(prior_stock, label="Prior Stock")
_reject_duplicate_stock_identity(current, label="Current Stock")
_reject_duplicate_stock_identity(prior, label="Prior Stock")
```

with:

```python

)
prior = _aggregate_stock_snapshot(
    validate_stock_frame(
        prior_stock,
        label="Prior Stock",
    )
)
```

Delete the complete `_reject_duplicate_stock_identity()` function.

Update the `compare_stock_snapshots()` docstring to:

```python
"""Outer-compare two Stock snapshots after summing duplicate source rows."""
```

## 32.2 Remove Portfolio after the Stock mapping join

### File: `core/s07_stock.py`

### Replace `MAPPED_STOCK_COMPARISON_COLUMNS`

```python
MAPPED_STOCK_COMPARISON_COLUMNS = (
    "CRDS",
    "CPTY",
    "Instrument",
    "Currency",
    *STOCK_COMPARISON_NUMERIC_COLUMNS,
    STOCK_CHANGE_COLUMN,
    *PORTFOLIO_METADATA_COLUMNS,
    PORTFOLIO_MAPPED_COLUMN,
)
```

### Replace `STOCK_FILTER_COLUMN_BY_KEY`

```python
STOCK_FILTER_COLUMN_BY_KEY = {
    field.key: field.external_name
    for field in PORTFOLIO_FIELDS
    if "filter_dimension" in field.roles

    portfolio_config: pd.DataFrame | str | Path,
) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Map through Portfolio, then publish a Portfolio-free comparison."""
    comparison = compare_stock_snapshots(
        current_stock,

    mapped = merge_config(
        comparison,
        portfolio_config,
    )
    return _collapse_mapped_stock_portfolios(mapped)
```

Do not change `STOCK_TEXT_COLUMNS`, `STOCK_COLUMNS`, or `STOCK_IDENTITY_COLUMNS`. The raw connector still needs Portfolio to identify and map source rows.

## 32.3 Load current Stock, prior Stock, and Portfolio mapping concurrently

This is a separate task pool inside the one Gunicorn process. It is not an additional Gunicorn worker.

Use one worker for the checked-in fake fixture. Use three workers only after the real Stock and Portfolio clients are confirmed thread-safe and have native I/O timeouts.

### File: `ui/s10_stock.py`

### Add imports near the top

```python
import os
from concurrent.futures import (
    ALL_COMPLETED,
    ThreadPoolExecutor,
    wait,
)
```

Keep `json` only until the old hierarchy code is deleted later in this section.

### Add above `load_stock_page_data()`

```python
def _positive_stock_setting(
    name: str,
    default: int,

    raw = os.getenv(name, str(default))

Delete the obsolete `promotion_threshold` parameter from callers of this function.

## 32.6 Replace the Stock placeholder

### Replace `build_stock_page_placeholder()` completely

```python

## 32.8 Replace the Stock filtering callback

### File: `ui/s09_factory.py`

### Replace the Stock imports from `.s10_stock`

Remove:

```python
STOCK_HIERARCHY_TOGGLE_TYPE
build_stock_hierarchy_panel_with_state
normalize_stock_promotion_threshold
normalize_stock_hierarchy_open_tokens
toggle_stock_hierarchy_open_tokens
```

Add:

```python
build_stock_aggregate_table
```

### Replace the complete current `filter_stock_table()` callback decorator and function

```python
@app.callback(
    Output("stock-row-count", "children"),
    Output("stock-mapped-count", "children"),
    Output("stock-unmapped-count", "children"),
    Output(
        "stock-dimension-filter-store",
        "data",
    ),
    Output("stock-aggregate-grid", "children"),
    *[
        Input(
            STOCK_FILTER_IDS[field.key],
            "value",
        )
        for field in STOCK_FILTER_FIELDS
    ],
    Input(
        "stock-filter-exclude-selected",
        "value",
    ),
    Input(
        "stock-aggregate-dimension",
        "value",
    ),
    Input("stock-loaded-dates", "data"),
    prevent_initial_call=True,
)
def filter_stock_table(*values):
    """Filter the cached Stock comparison and rebuild Aggregate Stock."""
    filter_count = len(STOCK_FILTER_FIELDS)
    selected_filter_values = values[:filter_count]
    exclude_value = values[filter_count]
    dimension = values[filter_count + 1]
    loaded_dates = values[filter_count + 2]

    key = stock_cache_key(loaded_dates)
    page_data = stock_cached_pages.get(key)
    if page_data is None:
        return (no_update,) * 5

    selected_filters = stock_filter_map(
        selected_filter_values
    )
    exclude_selected = stock_exclude_selected(
        exclude_value
    )
    filtered = filter_stock_comparison(
        page_data.mapped_stock,
        selected_filters,
        exclude_selected=exclude_selected,
    )
    rows, mapped, unmapped = stock_summary_text(
        filtered,
        total_rows=len(page_data.mapped_stock),
        current_date=page_data.current_date,
        prior_date=page_data.prior_date,
    )
    return (
        rows,
        mapped,
        unmapped,
        {
            "filters": selected_filters,
            "exclude_selected": exclude_selected,
        },
        build_stock_aggregate_table(
            filtered,
            dimension,
        ),
    )
```

Keep the lazy `render_stock_source_rows()` callback.

## 32.9 Reduce the process-local Stock cache

### File: `ui/s09_factory.py`

In `load_stock_revision()`, replace:

```python
if len(stock_cached_pages) > 8:
```

with:

```python
if len(stock_cached_pages) > 2:
```

## 32.10 Update `build_stock_table()` for the Portfolio-free mapped frame

### File: `ui/s10_stock.py`

The existing function can keep its DataTable styling, but remove this tooltip entry:

```python
"Portfolio": "Stock Portfolio used for the governed mapping",
```

The table automatically follows the new `MAPPED_STOCK_COMPARISON_COLUMNS` and therefore no longer exposes Portfolio.

Rename the source-row disclosure labels because the mapped comparison is now Portfolio-collapsed:

Replace:

```python
html.Summary("Source comparison rows")
```

with:

```python
html.Summary("Detailed comparison rows")
```

Replace:

```python
"Source comparison rows are not loaded. Load them only when needed."
```

with:

```python
"Detailed comparison rows are not loaded. Load them only when needed."
```

Replace button text:

```python
"Load filtered source rows"
```

with:

```python
"Load filtered detail rows"
```

Update the corresponding strings returned by `render_stock_source_rows()` in `ui/s09_factory.py`.

## 32.11 Delete the obsolete Stock hierarchy code

After the new page passes its focused tests, delete from `core/s07_stock.py`:

```text
STOCK_PROMOTION_BUCKET_COLUMN
STOCK_TEMPORARY_GROUP_COLUMN
STOCK_PROMOTION_THRESHOLD_DEFAULT
STOCK_HIERARCHY_COLUMNS
STOCK_PROMOTION_IDENTITY_COLUMNS
STOCK_HIERARCHY_* constants
normalize_stock_promotion_threshold()
prepare_stock_hierarchy()
_stock_hierarchy_metrics()
_ordered_stock_hierarchy_children()
summarize_stock_hierarchy()
summarize_visible_stock_hierarchy()
```

Delete from `ui/s10_stock.py`:

```text
STOCK_HIERARCHY_METRICS
STOCK_HIERARCHY_TOGGLE_TYPE
stock_hierarchy_path_token()
stock_hierarchy_path_from_token()
normalize_stock_hierarchy_open_tokens()
toggle_stock_hierarchy_open_tokens()
all hierarchy row/cell builders
build_stock_hierarchy* functions
```

Then remove unused imports:

```text
json
ROW_TOGGLE_CLOSED_GLYPH
ROW_TOGGLE_OPEN_GLYPH
all removed hierarchy constants/functions
```

Remove the deleted names from both modules' `__all__` lists.

`pages/stock.py` requires no change.

# 33. Keep the fake connector simple and deterministic

The fake connector is already more efficient than the recovered recommendation suggests:

- `_load_fake_csv()` is cached by file path, modification time and size.
- `_load_fake_source_partition()` is cached by dataset, file revision, Source Type and Underlying.
- callers receive defensive narrow copies.

Do not create a separate `asyncio` implementation for `pandas.read_csv()`. `read_csv()` is blocking, and the fixture data is already parsed once per file revision.

## 33.1 Keep fixture worker counts at one

For local tests and the checked-in fake data:

```bash
export CUBE_RISK_CONNECTOR_WORKERS=1
export CUBE_MARKET_CONNECTOR_WORKERS=1
export CUBE_STOCK_CONNECTOR_WORKERS=1
```

The manager-level concurrency code remains exercised by dedicated sleeping test connectors. It does not need to make the tiny fixture slower during every test.

## 33.2 Optional: reduce repeated `stat()` calls on network storage

Use this only when the fixture files are on NFS or another slow metadata filesystem.

### File: `feeds/s01_sources.py`

Add this import near the top:

```python
import time
```

Then add:

```python
_FAKE_REVISION_TTL_SECONDS = max(
    0.0,
    float(
        os.getenv(
            "CUBE_FAKE_REVISION_TTL_SECONDS",
            "0",
        )
    ),
)


@lru_cache(maxsize=64)
def _cached_fake_csv_revision(
    dataset: str,
    ttl_bucket: int,
) -> tuple[Path, str, int, int]:
    """Read one file revision per short metadata TTL bucket."""
    del ttl_bucket

    path = FAKE_CSV_FILES[dataset]
    stat = path.stat()
    return (
        path,
        str(path.resolve()),
        stat.st_mtime_ns,
        stat.st_size,
    )
```

Replace `_fake_csv_revision()` with:

```python
def _fake_csv_revision(
    dataset: str,
) -> tuple[Path, str, int, int]:
    """Return one file revision key with optional metadata TTL."""
    try:
        if _FAKE_REVISION_TTL_SECONDS <= 0:
            path = FAKE_CSV_FILES[dataset]
            stat = path.stat()
            return (
                path,
                str(path.resolve()),
                stat.st_mtime_ns,
                stat.st_size,
            )

        ttl_bucket = int(
            time.monotonic()
            // _FAKE_REVISION_TTL_SECONDS
        )
        return _cached_fake_csv_revision(
            dataset,
            ttl_bucket,
        )

    except OSError as exc:
        path = FAKE_CSV_FILES[dataset]
        raise FakeCsvConnectorError(
            (
                "Fake connector file is missing: "
                f"{path}. Restore it or replace the "
                f"{dataset!r} loader with a real function."
            )
        ) from exc
```

For local disk, leave:

```bash
export CUBE_FAKE_REVISION_TTL_SECONDS=0
```

For slow network metadata, test:

```bash
export CUBE_FAKE_REVISION_TTL_SECONDS=1
```

# 34. Keep one Gunicorn process and make request threads configurable

## File: `s04_server.py`

Replace the complete file with:

```python
"""Gunicorn settings for one authoritative process-local Cube snapshot."""

import os


workers = 1
worker_class = "gthread"
threads = int(os.getenv("GUNICORN_THREADS", "4"))

timeout = int(
    os.getenv(
        "GUNICORN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS",
        "300",
    )
)
graceful_timeout = int(
    os.getenv(
        "GUNICORN_GRACEFUL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS",
        "30",
    )
)
keepalive = int(
    os.getenv(
        "GUNICORN_KEEPALIVE_SECONDS",
        "5",
    )
)

# Do not preload or automatically recycle this process while the financial
# snapshot is process-local. Either action would trigger another cold start.
preload_app = False
max_requests = 0
```

This preserves the current four-thread default while allowing a controlled eight-thread benchmark. HTTP progress polling, Dash callbacks, and navigation continue to share one authoritative refresh manager.

Do not use multiple Gunicorn worker processes until the following are moved into shared storage:

- snapshot and revision;
- startup ownership;
- refresh lock and progress;
- prepared dashboard cache;
- Quick Search catalogue;
- Stock cache and request intent;
- last-good snapshot.

A future multi-process architecture should use Redis or another shared service and distribute revision-tagged immutable data. That is a separate project, not a one-line Gunicorn change.

---

# 35. Add faster Dash JSON serialization

## File: `requirements.txt`

Add:

```text
orjson==3.11.9
```

Do not change Dash, pandas, NumPy, or Plotly versions in the same patch.

Dash uses `orjson` automatically when it is installed.

---

# 36. Add final-stage timing logs

These logs prove whether the remaining cold-start delay is connector I/O, release aggregation, search-catalogue construction, or browser layout construction.

## File: `core/s02_pipeline.py`

The module already imports `time`.

### In `RiskRefreshManager.refresh()`, find the `_progress_step()` call whose function name is `_commit_full_snapshot` and whose stage is `final`

Immediately before that call, add:

```python
final_started = time.perf_counter()
```

Immediately before `_release_pl_views(...)`, add:

```python
release_started = time.perf_counter()
```

Immediately after `_release_pl_views(...)`, add:

```python
release_seconds = time.perf_counter() - release_started
LOGGER.info(
    "Cube release views completed in %.3fs; combined_pl=%s dashboard=%s "
    "unmapped=%s",
    release_seconds,
    len(enriched),
    len(dashboard),
    len(unmapped),
)
```

Immediately before `_build_snapshot_search_catalog(...)`, add:

```python
search_started = time.perf_counter()
```

Immediately after it, add:

```python
search_seconds = time.perf_counter() - search_started
LOGGER.info(
    "Cube search catalogue completed in %.3fs; dashboard_rows=%s",
    search_seconds,
    len(dashboard),
)
```

Immediately after `_commit_full_snapshot(...)`, add:

```python
LOGGER.info(
    "Cube final stage completed in %.3fs; revision=%s",
    time.perf_counter() - final_started,
    revision,
)
```

## File: `ui/s07_events.py`

Inside `materialize_initial_dashboard()`, before `read_dashboard()`, add:

```python
ui_started = monotonic()
```

After `build_layout(...)`, add:

```python
app.logger.info(
    "Cube initial dashboard UI built in %.3fs; revision=%s rows=%s",
    monotonic() - ui_started,
    dashboard_read.revision,
    len(prepared),
)
```

`monotonic` is already imported in this module.

---

# 37. Reduce the startup watchdog from forty minutes

The watchdog does not kill a connector; it only marks the startup as stalled. After adding connector-level timeouts and bounded task batches, forty minutes is too long for useful diagnosis.

## File: `ui/s09_factory.py`

Replace both default values of `2400` in startup-timeout parsing with `600`:

```python
raw_timeout = os.getenv(
    "CUBE_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS",
    "600",
)
```

and:

```python
startup_timeout = 600.0
```

Use a larger value through the environment only if measured successful cold starts legitimately exceed ten minutes.

---

# 38. Optional cleanup of recovered AI/comment blocks

Do this only after the functional and cold-start patches pass.

Delete the enormous comment-only connector implementations from:

- `adapters/s01_common.py`.
- `adapters/s02_ir.py`.
- `adapters/s03_fx.py`.
- `adapters/s04_credit.py`.
- `feeds/s01_sources.py`.

Delete recovered comment-only alternatives from `core/s02_pipeline.py`, including:

- MRX/MMM field alternatives.
- unused formula-name alternatives.
- recovered ProductSpec alternatives.
- recovered Age arithmetic.

Keep the active adapter contracts and the new `run_async` implementation.

If you perform this cleanup, also update:

- `README.md`, which currently claims recovered bodies are kept inline;
- `tests/s20_connector_provenance.py`, which explicitly requires those blocks;
- `tests/s21_pipeline_provenance.py`, which explicitly requires recovered pipeline markers;
- `tests/s13_publish.py`, which checks selected marker text in the staged runtime.

Do not delete these useful structures:

- `HierarchyAggregationIndex`.
- `_MarketQuoteIndex`.
- revision-specific prepared dashboard caching.
- StartupCoordinator.
- atomic snapshot publication.
- last-good-snapshot behavior.
- Stock stale-request protection.
- lazy detailed-row loading.

---

---

# 39. Update the tests

Run test changes in the same commits as their behaviour changes.

## 39.1 Portfolio registry and release

### File: `tests/s19_risk_filters.py`

Add:

```python
assert "portfolio" not in {
    field.key
    for field in FILTER_DIMENSION_FIELDS
}

assert "portfolio" not in {
    field.key
    for field in VIEW_DIMENSION_FIELDS
}
```

Replace Portfolio filter examples with Activity or Category.

Delete tests for `filter_unmapped_portfolios`.

## 39.2 Add a dashboard collapse integration test

Use two mapped rows that differ only by Portfolio:

```python
def test_dashboard_collapses_portfolio_after_mapping():
    dashboard = to_dashboard_frame(
        mapped_two_portfolio_frame()
    )

    assert "Portfolio" not in dashboard.columns
    assert len(dashboard) == 1
    assert dashboard["Risk"].iloc[0] == 30.0
    assert dashboard["dRisk"].iloc[0] == 3.0
    assert dashboard["PL"].iloc[0] == 10.0
    assert dashboard["Open"].iloc[0] == 3.0
    assert dashboard["Current"].iloc[0] == 4.0
    assert dashboard["Move"].iloc[0] == 1.0
```

Do not compare all `combined_pl` totals to dashboard totals when unmapped Portfolio rows exist. Compare only mapped input rows.

## 39.3 Saved views

### File: `tests/s23_saved_views.py`

Expected keys become:

```python
(
    "activity",
    "signoffgroup",
    "category",
    "subcategory",
)
```

Remove Portfolio from fixtures and expected JSON.

Change the CSS assertion from five columns to four.

## 39.4 Partial Credit

### File: `tests/s06_ui.py`

Add:

```python
def test_partial_credit_measure_remains_available():
    frame = credit_frame().copy()
    frame.loc[0, "risk sp01"] = np.nan

    assert credit_measure_available(
        frame,
        "SP01",
    )

    values = credit_measure_values(
        frame,
        "risk",
        "SP01",
    )

    assert pd.isna(values.iloc[0])
    assert values.iloc[1:].notna().all()
```

Add an all-missing test that expects the measure to be unavailable.

## 39.5 Market duplicate and tenor tests

### File: `tests/s04_market.py`

Replace tests expecting failure for:

- duplicate market keys
- conflicting tenor ranks
- Open/Current rank disagreement

Add tests asserting:

```python
def test_duplicate_open_quotes_are_averaged():
    result = get_product_market_open(
        spec,
        market_date,
        duplicate_open_frame,
    )

    assert result["Open"].iloc[0] == pytest.approx(
        duplicate_open_frame["Open"].mean()
    )
```

```python
def test_duplicate_current_quotes_are_averaged():
    result = get_product_market_status(
        spec,
        market_date,
        duplicate_current_frame,
        market_status="Live",
    )

    assert result["Current"].iloc[0] == pytest.approx(
        duplicate_current_frame["Current"].mean()
    )
```

```python
def test_misaligned_orders_are_normalized():
    result = get_product_market(
        spec,
        market_date,
        open_frame_with_conflicts,
        current_frame_with_conflicts,
        market_status="Live",
    )

    orders = result[
        "Tenor Swap Order"
    ].drop_duplicates().sort_values().tolist()

    assert orders == list(range(len(orders)))
```

## 39.6 Reported Underlying market aggregate

### File: `tests/s06_ui.py`

Create several raw Underlyings under one Reported Underlying and assert Open, Current and Move appear at the Reported Underlying row.

## 39.7 Cold startup shell

### File: `tests/s12_startup.py`

Cold shell:

```python
assert progress.hidden is False
assert (
    progress.to_plotly_json()["props"]
    ["data-initial-load"]
    == "true"
)
assert bootstrap_interval.disabled is False
```

Warm shell:

```python
assert progress.hidden is True
```

Change the JavaScript assertion to:

```python
assert "hasNewError ? 5000 : 1500" in source
assert "Date.now() + 60000" in source
```

Add a test that `serve_layout()` calls `schedule_start()` once for a cold manager and not for a warm manager.

## 39.8 Targeted dashboard read

Add a test that `read_dashboard()` returns one dashboard frame and compact control view without exposing the large P&L, MarketBook or unmapped frames.

Add:

```python
dashboard_read = manager.read_dashboard()

assert dashboard_read.revision == manager.health.revision
assert isinstance(dashboard_read.frame, pd.DataFrame)
assert dashboard_read.control.revision == dashboard_read.revision
assert not hasattr(dashboard_read, "combined_pl")
assert not hasattr(dashboard_read, "market_frame")
assert not hasattr(dashboard_read, "unmapped_frame")
```

Mutate the returned `frame` and `control.risk_status` in the test, then call `read_dashboard()` again and assert the committed manager values were not changed.

## 39.9 Startup no-copy return

Update all test fake-manager `refresh()` signatures to accept:

```python
copy_result: bool = True,
```

Add a test that `StartupCoordinator` calls revision 1 with `copy_result=False`.

## 39.10 Connector concurrency

Add a bounded-concurrency test:

```python
from threading import Lock
from time import sleep


def test_market_connector_uses_bounded_workers():
    lock = Lock()
    active = 0
    peak = 0

    def market_open(
        market_date,
        underlying,
        *,
        market_status,
    ):
        nonlocal active, peak

        with lock:
            active += 1
            peak = max(peak, active)

        try:
            sleep(0.05)
            return open_frame_for(underlying)
        finally:
            with lock:
                active -= 1

    manager = build_manager(
        market_open_loader=market_open,
        market_workers=3,
    )

    manager.refresh(
        expected_revision=0,
        copy_result=False,
    )

    assert 1 < peak <= 3
```

Add the same test with `market_workers=1` and assert `peak == 1`.

## 39.11 Stock

### File: `tests/s17_stock.py`

Remove hierarchy-path, promotion-threshold and temporary-group tests.

Add tests asserting:

- duplicate raw identities are summed
- Portfolio is still used during mapping
- mapped public output has no Portfolio column
- Activity aggregate equals the sum of detailed collapsed rows
- prior/current/change values are correct
- the page contains `stock-aggregate-dimension`
- the page contains `stock-aggregate-grid`
- the page has no `stock-hierarchy-open-paths`
- the page has no `stock-promotion-threshold`

## 39.12 Fake fixture mode

In test setup, set:

```python
monkeypatch.setenv(
    "CUBE_RISK_CONNECTOR_WORKERS",
    "1",
)
monkeypatch.setenv(
    "CUBE_MARKET_CONNECTOR_WORKERS",
    "1",
)
monkeypatch.setenv(
    "CUBE_STOCK_CONNECTOR_WORKERS",
    "1",
)
```

This keeps fixture tests deterministic. Concurrency has its own explicit tests.

# 41. Recommended environment settings

## 41.1 Fake/local fixture mode

```bash
export CUBE_RISK_CONNECTOR_WORKERS=1
export CUBE_MARKET_CONNECTOR_WORKERS=1
export CUBE_FAKE_REVISION_TTL_SECONDS=0
export RISK_PRODUCT_DELAY_SECONDS=0
export GUNICORN_THREADS=4
export CUBE_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=600
```

## 41.2 Initial real-source mode

Use only after confirming private client thread-safety and rate limits:

```bash
export CUBE_RISK_CONNECTOR_WORKERS=2
export CUBE_MARKET_CONNECTOR_WORKERS=4
export CUBE_STOCK_CONNECTOR_WORKERS=3
export CUBE_CONNECTOR_BATCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=300
export CUBE_ASYNC_CONNECTOR_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=120
export CUBE_PORTFOLIO_BATCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=180
export CUBE_STOCK_BATCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=180
export CUBE_USE_REAL_PORTFOLIO_CONFIG=1
export RISK_PRODUCT_DELAY_SECONDS=0
export GUNICORN_THREADS=4
export GUNICORN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=300
export CUBE_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=600
```

After the application is stable, benchmark each change separately:

```bash
export CUBE_RISK_CONNECTOR_WORKERS=4
export CUBE_MARKET_CONNECTOR_WORKERS=8
```

Then restore the best connector values and benchmark:

```bash
export GUNICORN_THREADS=8
```

Do not change Gunicorn process count.

# 42. Production acceptance checklist

## Cold start

- `/healthz` responds before the first source call completes.
- `/progressz` changes at least once every normal source-duration interval.
- `startup_phase` changes from `idle` to `running` without requiring a manual refresh.
- a source timeout produces a visible failed startup instead of an indefinite wait.
- revision changes from 0 to 1.
- the hero remains visible until the page has adopted revision 1.
- the completion state remains visible for 1.5 seconds.
- the browser does not enter a reload loop.

## Cardinality

- `combined_pl` contains Portfolio.
- `dashboard_frame` does not contain Portfolio.
- the log prints `Dashboard rows after removing Portfolio: before -> after`.
- mapped Risk/dRisk/P&L totals are preserved.
- Quick Search does not require Portfolio.
- Risk, P&L and Stock filters do not contain Portfolio.

## Credit and market

- one missing SP01/PSP01/PM01 leaf does not hide the measure.
- all-missing measures remain unavailable.
- duplicate quotes are averaged.
- Move equals Current minus Open after aggregation.
- conflicting tenor ranks do not abort refresh.
- final tenor ranks are unique and consecutive.
- Reported Underlying displays aggregated market values.

## Concurrency

- real source clients have native timeouts.
- market concurrency never exceeds `CUBE_MARKET_CONNECTOR_WORKERS`.
- fake tests use one connector worker.
- upstream services are not overloaded.
- one connector failure cancels the transaction and no partial snapshot is committed.

## Stock

- duplicate raw Stock rows are summed.
- Portfolio is removed after mapping.
- Aggregate Stock has the same View-by vocabulary as P&L.
- detailed rows remain lazy.
- promotion and custom hierarchy state are gone.
- the Stock cache contains at most two comparisons.

## Server

- Gunicorn uses one process.
- Gunicorn uses `gthread`.
- thread count is configurable.
- `preload_app` is false.
- no automatic worker recycling recreates unnecessary cold starts.

# 43. Expected result

After completing the guide:

- a cold worker becomes HTTP-reachable before connectors finish
- startup begins from the persistent shell, JavaScript endpoint, page-local interval, or delayed server fallback without duplicate writers
- a hung private source fails on a bounded timeout instead of freezing forever
- real Risk and market I/O can overlap through bounded connector threads
- the fake fixture remains simple, cached and deterministic
- the browser no longer waits for full copies of unrelated frames
- the Risk and P&L pages no longer build initial tables twice
- Portfolio disappears from the browser-facing analytical cube and Quick Search
- partial Credit measures remain visible
- duplicate market quotes are averaged
- tenor order conflicts are normalized
- Reported Underlying displays market aggregates
- Stock becomes a simple P&L-style aggregate page
- one Gunicorn process remains the authoritative owner of in-memory state
- Dash uses faster JSON serialization
